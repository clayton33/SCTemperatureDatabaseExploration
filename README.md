# SCTemperatureDatabaseExploration
 A RShiny application to investigate data included in the snow crab sc_temp_merge database
 
## To use
Simply open up either the `.Rproj` file or `app.R`. When `app.R` is open, click on the `Run App` button in the top left corner of the script panel (the default is the top-left panel).

## Notes
* For the time being, scripts to obtain data have been omitted for simplicity, but will be added if there is an interest.
